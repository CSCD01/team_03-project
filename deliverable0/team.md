### Gagan
My name is Gaganpreet Kaberwal and I am a 4th year computer science student at Uoft Scarborough. I am specializing in Software Engineering and my expected graduation is after winter of 2021.

I have completed two work terms over the course of my coop program. My first work term was at Ministry of Education where I fulfilled the role of a .NET developer. During the course of this workterm, I deployed app services/VMs using MS Azure and optimized environment creation powershell scripts to minimize deployment time. My second work term was over the course of 12 months where I worked as a DevOps Engineer at Oracle Corporation. I automated time consuming processes using ruby scripting and added features to a web-app with an Angular front end while querying Chef data to update SQL databases. One of the major everyday tasks was to monitor environmental errors and Teamcity build pipelines to ensure successful deployments.

Due to my previous projects and work experiences, I have gained experience in Python, Java, C, Javascript, Ruby, Powershell and C#. I am also familiar with technologies like Angular, Sideqik, MySql, Rest etc. 

I hope all these skills with help me deliver results for my team to the best potential.

### Harsh
Hi I'm Harsh Patel, I am a 4th year computer science student at the University of Toronto with a specialist in Software Engineering and a minor in Statistics. I will be graduating in the April of 2021 after completing 4 internships.

I have completed three work terms through the Computer Science Coop program, each one being 4 months each. My first work term was at Public Services and Procurment Canada as a web developer where I generated the yearly financial reports of the Canadian government. My second work term was at Index Exchange an ad-tech company where I did full stack work to improve usability of the clients wanting to place ads on websites. My third work term was at Cyclica a Bio-tech start-up where I added features that help users analysis compounds more efficiency and optimized the core machine learning engine.

I will be working at Coinbase in the summer where I hope to learn more concepts about computer science and contribute to the best of my ability.

I have experience in C, C++, Java, Python, Javacript, and various other languages and am familar with frameworks like LLVM, Django, Springboot, Node.js, React, and more.

I look forward to working with my team and contributing in a manner that will help others.

### Kohilan Mohanarajan
My name is Kohilan Mohanarajan, a 4<sup>th</sup> year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus.  I'm currently specializing in the Software Engineering stream for my degree, and am in the co-op program.  I anticipate that I will finish my degree by the end of 2020.  

I've completed three work terms as a part of my program; first as a Web Development co-op with the Toronto District School Board, then as a Software Engineer co-op with International Financial Data Services, and then finally taking an extended 8-month term as a Software Engineer co-op at Aviva Canada.  

Work that I've done at all three of my co-op work terms have reached production.  For example, the work I did on the TDSB's Library modules are being used by roughly 54 000 staff and over 200 000 students on a daily basis.  The development work I did on several of Aviva's internal apps are used by Aviva's brokers and agents to help expedite their workflow.

I have hands-on experience with Java, Python, the MEAN stack, React, and C, to name a few of the languages/frameworks I know, and hope to put my skills to use effectively as a part of this team.

## Team Agreement

### Methods of Communication 
Communication will occur through Facebook Messenger and Discord Voice Messenger.  

Discord is a team voice and text chat service. It is similar to Slack, but is prioritized for voice communication. We used it to hold meetings and discuss the product backlog. We benefitted from its easy-to-use system, something that many of us had previously used.

Facebook Messenger is a text chat service.  We used it whenever a quick response was required. Planning for meetings and questions about individual work were done through Messenger.

Text communication will primarily occur over Facebook Messenger for quicker responses, and Discord will be used for vocal communication that requires more time, such as team meetings.

### Communication Response Times 
The expectations is that all text communication over Facebook Messenger will have a turnaround time of at most half an hour, as everyone in the group has quick access to the app.  With Discord, the response time is near-instant once the voice call is initiated, the wait times come from waiting for all members to come online.  As meetings will occur at set times, the wait time will only occur when there are technical difficulties setting up audio equipment and establishing a connection.

### Meeting Attendance
Whether the meetings are mandatory or not , and when they occur will be determined by the content of the meetings.  For instance, if two members are working on similar tasks and want to meet, but don't require the rest of the team, then they can arrange for that on their own time. 

Attendance in meetings will be logged in a separate file titled `meetinglogs.md`, along with meeting notes.  Each meeting will have its own section in the file, and part of that section will include a list of all members present in that meeting. 

### Running Meetings 

### Meeting Preparation 

### Version Control 
For each commit, the commit message must follow this format: `DELIV[N] - [Name of Committer] - [Commit message]`, where `N` is the current sprint/deliverable, i.e. for Deliverable 0, it would be `DELIV0`.

### Division of Work 

### Submitting Deliverables 

### Contingency Planning 

#### If a team member drops out

#### If a team member consistently misses meetings 

#### What if a team member is academically dishonest
