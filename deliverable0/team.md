### Kohilan Mohanarajan
My name is Kohilan Mohanarajan, a 4<sup>th</sup> year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus.  I'm currently specializing in the Software Engineering stream for my degree, and am in the co-op program.  I anticipate that I will finish my degree by the end of 2020.  

I've completed three work terms as a part of my program; first as a Web Development co-op with the Toronto District School Board, then as a Software Engineer co-op with International Financial Data Services, and then finally taking an extended 8-month term as a Software Engineer co-op at Aviva Canada.  

Work that I've done at all three of my co-op work terms have reached production.  For example, the work I did on the TDSB's Library modules are being used by roughly 54 000 staff and over 200 000 students on a daily basis.  The development work I did on several of Aviva's internal apps are used by Aviva's brokers and agents to help expedite their workflow.

I have hands-on experience with Java, Python, the MEAN stack, React, and C, to name a few of the languages/frameworks I know, and hope to put my skills to use effectively as a part of this team.

### Kanstantsin Ilioukevitch

I am Kanstantsin Ilioukevitch, a 4<sup>th</sup> year Computer Science student currently studying at the University of Toronto. Set in the Software Engineering stream at the Scarborough Campus; I have completed one year of co-op terms as part of my degree and am set to graduate in April of 2021. 

My future field interest within Computer Science is Cyber-Security - with a specific interest in network security, malware, and penetration testing. My first co-op term was at the Ministry of Education, Community Services Cluster, as a QA Analyst in charge of administration of the main testing suite - along with other responsibilites. The reamining time was spent at RBC within the RSS team, my responsiblities were upkeep of very high profile business reports, along with the development of an automated project management report to be sent to upper management, directors, and Dave McKay - CEO of RBC. 

I have had hands on experience with C, Java, Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Haskell, and Scheme; with strong preferences to Python, JavaScript, Java, and C.

## Team Agreement

### Methods of Communication 
Communication will occur through Facebook Messenger and Discord Voice Messenger.  Text communication will primarily occur over Facebook Messenger for quicker responses, and Discord will be used for vocal communication that requires more time, such as team meetings.

### Communication Response Times 
The expectations is that all text communication over Facebook Messenger will have a turnaround time of at most half an hour, as everyone in the group has quick access to the app.  With Discord, the response time is near-instant once the voice call is initiated, the wait times come from waiting for all members to come online.  As meetings will occur at set times, the wait time will only occur when there are technical difficulties setting up audio equipment and establishing a connection.

### Meeting Attendance
Whether the meetings are mandatory or not , and when they occur will be determined by the content of the meetings.  For instance, if two members are working on similar tasks and want to meet, but don't require the rest of the team, then they can arrange for that on their own time. 

Attendance in meetings will be logged in a separate file titled `meetinglogs.md`, along with meeting notes.  Each meeting will have its own section in the file, and part of that section will include a list of all members present in that meeting.
