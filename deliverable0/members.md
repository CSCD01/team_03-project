## Kohilan Mohanarajan
My name is Kohilan Mohanarajan, a 4<sup>th</sup> year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus.  I'm currently specializing in the Software Engineering stream for my degree, and am in the co-op program.  I anticipate that I will finish my degree by the end of 2020.  

I've completed three work terms as a part of my program; first as a Web Development co-op with the Toronto District School Board, then as a Software Engineer co-op with International Financial Data Services, and then finally taking an extended 8-month term as a Software Engineer co-op at Aviva Canada.  

Work that I've done at all three of my co-op work terms have reached production.  For example, the work I did on the TDSB's Library modules are being used by roughly 54 000 staff and over 200 000 students on a daily basis.  The development work I did on several of Aviva's internal apps are used by Aviva's brokers and agents to help expedite their workflow.

I have hands-on experience with Java, Python, the MEAN stack, React, and C, to name a few of the languages/frameworks I know, and hope to put my skills to use effectively as a part of this team.
