# Team Agreement

## Methods of Communication 
Communication will occur through Facebook Messenger and Discord Voice Messenger.  Text communication will primarily occur over Facebook Messenger for quicker responses, and Discord will be used for vocal communication that requires more time, such as team meetings.

## Communication Response Times 
The expectations is that all text communication over Facebook Messenger will have a turnaround time of at most half an hour, as everyone in the group has quick access to the app.  With Discord, the response time is near-instant once the voice call is initiated, the wait times come from waiting for all members to come online.  As meetings will occur at set times, the wait time will only occur when there are technical difficulties setting up audio equipment and establishing a connection.

## Meeting Attendance
Whether the meetings are mandatory or not , and when they occur will be determined by the content of the meetings.  For instance, if two members are working on similar tasks and want to meet, but don't require the rest of the team, then they can arrange for that on their own time. 

Attendance in meetings will be logged in a separate file titled `meetinglogs.md`, along with meeting notes.  Each meeting will have its own section in the file, and part of that section will include a list of all members present in that meeting.
