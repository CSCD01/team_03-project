**Comments**: Lost marks on correctness because no pull requests. Documentation is tricky to mark because there is none but none is needed. I think the deliverable was rushed and certain things could've been explained better. For example: "risks were evaluated and a scientific method for generating a hypothesis was used to allow team-level understanding of the problem"

**Comments**: First demo did not go smoothly. Some members did not know how bugs were fixed. Knew how testing was done in the project but could not talk about it in-depth since not familiar with testing software

**Comments**: Feels bad that they determined the issue was intended behaviour. But good job following up with the maintainers.    Design document missing.   
Note for future: set reviewers on the pull request page on github, and the reviewer (assigned or not) can go to the files changes page, click review changes, and then approve or comment. This makes it so people can be held accountable later
